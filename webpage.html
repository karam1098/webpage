        <p>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family.[13] His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a housewife.[14][15] He has an older brother, Vikash, and an older sister, Bhavna.[16]

            Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar[17] and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School.[14][18] In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created and a nine-year-old Kohli was part of its first intake.[17] Kohli trained at the academy under Rajkumar Sharma[15] and also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave at the same time.[17] In ninth grade, he shifted to Saviour Convent in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket practice.[14][19] Kohli's family lived in Meera Bagh until 2015 when they moved to Gurgaon.[20]
            
            Kohli's father died on 18 December 2006 due to a stroke after being bed-ridden for a month.[14]</p>

        <p>Following the Under-19 World Cup, Kohli was bought by the Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000 on a youth contract.[40][41] In June 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. The scholarship allowed the three players to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.[37] He was also picked in the India Emerging Players squad for the four-team Emerging Players Tournament and scored 206 runs in six matches at an average of 41.20.[4
         Raina was named captain and Kohli vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe in Mayâ€“June 2010, as many first-choice players skipped the tour.[73] Kohli made 168 runs at an average of 42.00 including two fifties,[74] but India suffered three defeats in four matches and crashed out of the series. During the series, Kohli became the fastest Indian batsman to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket.[75] He made his T20I debut against Zimbabwe at Harare and scored an unbeaten 26.[76] Later that month, Kohli batted at 3 in an Indian team throughout the 2010 Asia Cup and scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75.[77] His struggles with form continued in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where he averaged 15.[78] </p>
